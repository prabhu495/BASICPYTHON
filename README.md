#Basic Python
=>Tuples in pyton:
Tuple is a collection of Python objects much like a list. The sequence of values stored in a tuple can be of any type, and they are indexed by integers.
Values of a tuple are syntactically separated by ‘commas’. Although it is not necessary, it is more common to define a tuple by closing the sequence of values in parentheses. This helps in understanding the Python tuples more easily.
=>Creating a tuple
In Python, tuples are created by placing sequence of values separated by ‘comma’ with or without the use of parentheses for grouping of data sequence.
=>Concatenation of Tuples
Concatenation of tuple is the process of joining of two or more Tuples. Concatenation is done by the use of ‘+’ operator. Concatenation of tuples is done always from the end of the original tuple. Other arithmetic operations do not apply on Tuples.
Note- Only same datatypes can be combined with concatenation, an error arises if a list and a tuple are combined.
